Grand Prix Attack - Chess Pathways
==================================


The Grand Prix Attack is a variant of the very popular Sicilian Defense. Several move orders can be used to reach the Grand Prix Attack, but a common order might be 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4. Rather than opening up the center with an early d2-d4, white strives to increase his space advantage and mount the beginnings of a kingside attack.
