Slav Defense - Chess Openings - Chess.com
=========================================


The Slav Defense is a solid opening for Black in response to White's Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4). Black fights for equality against one of White's most popular openings without creating a bad light-squared bishopâ€”one of the downsides of other defenses like the French Defense and the Queen's Gambit Declined.
