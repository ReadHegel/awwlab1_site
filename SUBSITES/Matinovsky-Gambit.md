The Matinovsky Gambit - Opening Guide for White & Black - Chessable
===================================================================


The Matinovsky Gambit is an opening arising out of the Owen's Defense after the move order 1.e4 b6 2.d4 Bb7 3.Bd3 f5. The idea of the opening is for White to accept the pawn on f5 and for Black to target White's g2 pawn and rook on h1. If White knows how to respond, they can seize the initiative and are much better off.
